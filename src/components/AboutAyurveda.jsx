      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Ayurveda</strong> is an ancient Indian system of medicine that emphasizes holistic health and harmony between body, mind, and spirit. It is based on balancing three fundamental energies (doshas): <strong>Vata</strong>, <strong>Pitta</strong>, and <strong>Kapha</strong>. Ayurveda uses natural remedies, diet, lifestyle, and therapies to prevent and treat illness, focusing on personalized care for each individual.
